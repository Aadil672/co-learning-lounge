    "Text normalization is the process of transforming text into a canonical (standard) form. For example, the word “loooove” and “luv” can be transformed to “love”, its canonical form. Another example is mapping of near identical words such as “stopwords”, “stop-words” and “stop words” to just “stopwords”.\n",
